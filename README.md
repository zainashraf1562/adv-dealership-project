# Car Dealership

## Description of the Project

In this program you are able to view cars, add cars, remove cars, lease cars, finance cars, buy cars and view all the cars.
It saves everything in a text file so the cars will not be lost when you close the application.
## User Stories

- I should, as a user, want the application to be centered from a single main entry point, so that I am able to just run the program.
- I should, as a user, get to view a menu on the screen where I can choose what action to take in the dealership application.
- I should, as a user, get the system to store information regarding vehicles and dealerships, so that my information is structured and can be reused subsequently.
- I should, as a user, I want the system to save and load car information from a file, so that dealership stock is preserved between sessions.
- I should, as a user, want to delete, add, and search for cars, so that I can manage the dealership's stock in a convenient way.
- I should, as a user want to lease or buy a car, also be able to finance a car I am buying.
